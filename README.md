# LiRA
Literature Review Assistant (LiRA) is a chatbot designed to assist in performing literature reviews.
Specifically, given the title of a paper which is freely accessible on the web, LiRA will search the references within the paper to find related papers which may further explain some topic central to the start paper.
Lira will also have functions to review all newly submitted papers for the current day, presenting a summary of the topics explored in each, or simply a list of new papers which explore topics the user has denoted as topics of interest.

LiRA is currently in the beginning stages of development, but is expected to be functional on April 10th, 2022.
